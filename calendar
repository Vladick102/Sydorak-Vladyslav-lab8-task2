'''
The logic puzzle game board has a square shape with 9Ã—9 cells.
The board contains cells of different colors that are used in
the game and white areas that are not used for the game. 
The validate_board function is used to determine
if the logic puzzle board is ready to start the game.
The cells of the board must be filled in according to the
following rules before the game starts:

1) The colored cells of each row must contain
numbers from 1 to 9 without repetition.

2) The colored cells of each column must contain
digits from 1 to 9 without repetition.

3) Each block of cells of the same color must contain
digits from 1 to 9 without repetition.

    '''
    The validate_board(board) function returns a Boolean value.
    For example, for a game board, in the doctype, the function
    returns False, since the fifth column contains two digits 1.
